[//]: # "About me"
# Hugo Alonso Luis

Hi!, A *happy human* that loves being a `coder` over here!

I‚Äôm always eager to improve my skills and explore other points of view. I started to code in **Delphi**, **C++** & **Java**, after several languages and technologies.., I‚Äôm now comfortably using **Swift** for creating iOS apps.

I‚Äôm really curious, so I like to get a grasp of almost every disruptive technology‚Ä¶ I guess I‚Äôm kind of a technological polygamist üòÖ.

Oh.. **I enjoy teaching**, I have been a üë®üèª‚Äçüè´ for several years and through StackOverflow, I have had the opportunity to continue when not in the classroom.

‚úåüèª

### My contribution

I was part of the initial team working on the creation of all the online presence of FORA (Android, iOS, Web, Backend).

My role, as part of a team of 4 iOS developers, was to create the Minimum Viable Product. Our teamwork and motivation resulted in achieving the goals in record time and retain an important client.

## Marvel Characters

[Marvel Characters](https://gitlab.com/hugoalonsoluis/marvel-characters) is a take-home project I completed as part of the interview process for an iOS Developer role in Portugal.

The prototype/design was provided as a [Marvel Prototype](https://marvelapp.com/279b309/screen/10499832). The main idea was to present data from the [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com/).

</p>

### My contribution

I created a completely functional version in approximately 14 days using Swift 3, [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) and Storyboards. It uses [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) for networking and [KingFisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) for the caching of images. For handling dependencies it was used [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).

This was the first time I used blur effects and custom transitions in an app, and I ‚ù§Ô∏èit!

Later on, I started experimenting with it and it has been my playground for testing and Continuous Integration using [GitlabCI](https://about.gitlab.com/product/continuous-integration/). Currently is updated to Swift 5.

## Cachivache

[Cachivache](https://gitlab.com/hugoalonsoluis/Cachivache) was a project for allowing to download and visualize the contents of an independent, young, and energetic publication startup dealing with the challenges that suppose the lack of connectivity in Cuba.

Main goal being to be able to bring offline access to all the posts made by their publication (cachivachemedia.com) It‚Äôs some sort of a Pocket, but exclusively for them and having special consideration for offline us

It allowed to:

- Favorite, download and visualize posts.
- Set, edit and filter by tags.
- Analytics across the app.

</p>

### My contribution

For this project, I was the solo-developer. The app was in the AppStore until the publication decided to stop their project.

Among the main challenges: - Download the content from the posts from Medium (where the publication is hosted) - Provide a customizable and reliable offline experience. - Guarantee that all the content is downloaded as fast as possible while connected to the internet (as in Cuba the internet is slow and limited/expensive in time)

</p>

### My contribution

This app was created in the following months of the release of the widgets and apple watch APIs from Apple.

The most challenging part of the development was the need to explore the limits of the Widgets environment and discover & fix undocumented memory issues.

From here that the app had to be rebuilt 3 times before we could publish it in the AppStore. Our standards about quality were high, and we couldn‚Äôt allow an app that would close itself in unexpected moments.

I can‚Äôt deny that it was super fun and challenging to create. I was leading a team of 4 iOS developers working on the app from concept to the AppStore.

</p>

### My contribution

This was my first project as an iOS Developer. I was part of a team of 4 highly motivated guys craving for knowledge and excited about Swift.

We built the app from scratch and many of it‚Äôs following iterations once it was published in the AppStore. The work made demanded a lot of communication, collaboration, and iterations in design.

## Beattune - Meaningful Heart Rate

BeatTune gets its heart rate directly in real-time from the sensor on the Apple Watch by means of the Health App.

The measurements were visile on the iPhone and on the Apple Watch. 

The aim was to enhance lives and heighten awareness by monitoring any heart rate irregularities. BeatTune was able to show if the heart rate readings were in line with the type of activity. It was also able to highlights any irregularities that show up and keep a record of them.
