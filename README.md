# Hugo Alonso Luis

Hi!,
A *happy human* that loves being a `coder` over here!

I'm always eager to improve my skills and explore other points of view. I started to code in **Delphi**, **C++** & **Java**, after several languages and technologies.., I'm now comfortably using **Swift** for creating iOS apps. 

I'm really curious, so I like to get a grasp of almost every disruptive technology... I guess I'm kind of a technological polygamist üòÖ. 

Oh.. **I enjoy teaching**, I have been a üë®üèª‚Äçüè´ for several years and through StackOverflow, I have had the opportunity to continue when not in the classroom.

# Marvel Characters

[Marvel Characters](https://gitlab.com/hugoalonsoluis/marvel-characters) is a take-home project I completed as part of the interview process for an iOS Developer role in Portugal.

The prototype/design was provided as a [Marvel Prototype](https://marvelapp.com/279b309/screen/10499832). The main idea was to present data from the [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com).

I created a functional version in approximately 14 days using Swift 3, [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) and Storyboards. It uses [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) for networking and [KingFisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) for caching of images. For handling dependencies it was used [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).

This was the first time I used blur effects and custom transitions in an app, and I ‚ù§Ô∏èit!

Later on, I started experimenting with it and it has been my playground for testing and Continuous Integration using [GitlabCI](https://about.gitlab.com/product/continuous-integration/). Currently is updated to Swift 5.
