# Marvel Characters

[![Dependency Injection][badge_carthage]][carthage]

[Marvel Characters](https://gitlab.com/hugoalonsoluis/marvel-characters) is a take-home project I completed as part of the interview process for an iOS Developer role. 

The prototype/design was provided as a [Marvel Prototype](https://marvelapp.com/279b309/screen/10499832). The main idea was to obtain and present data from the [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com).

I created a functional version in approximately 14 days using Swift 3, [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) and Storyboards. It uses [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) for networking and [KingFisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) for caching of images.

This was the first time I used blur effects and custom transitions in an app, and I ❤️it! They can be appreciated in this [small video recorded in the simulator][marvelCharactersVideo].

Later on, I started experimenting with it and it has been my playground for testing and Continuous Integration using [GitlabCI](https://about.gitlab.com/product/continuous-integration/). Currently is updated to Swift 5.
